      Japan has a history of 2,000 years. Its name is a combination of two ideograms, meaning "sun" and "beginning". It consists of four large islands, Hokkaido, Shikoku, Kyushu and Honshu, which are also accompanied by thousands of smaller ones (to
      be precise, the Japanese archipelago consists of 6,852 islands). Its largest city and capital is Tokyo, which together with the metropolitan area has more than 30 million inhabitants. In total, the country has a population, based on statistics
      for 2010, 127,360,000. Japan has the second largest economy in the world, by nominal GDP (although recent Chinese government figures suggest that China is now the second largest) and the third largest in terms of purchasing power. It is also
      the fourth largest exporter in the world and the fifth largest importer. Japan is especially known for its culture. In Japan, the No theater was developed, a word meaning "performance, performance, drama". The actors perform it with slow and
      religious movements. Many first-time visitors to Japan are often surprised to learn that as one of the most advanced industrial countries in the world, this relatively small Asian country also has a rich and fascinating history dating back
      thousands of years. Indeed, long before the construction of many of Europe's most impressive cathedrals, the Japanese Shinto and Buddhist temples were already established, painting pilgrims and patrons for their often elaborate designs and
      decorations. At the same time, the country had already perfected the skills and occupations that would put it on the path to wealth, from porcelain and ceramics to textiles such as silk. Much of this rich tradition has been preserved (or
      rebuilt), despite wars and natural disasters, and these days, a visit to Japan is an unforgettable adventure.

      Tokyo's most famous landmark, the Imperial Palace, with its beautiful 17th-century parks surrounded by walls and moats, is a must-see when visiting the nation's capital.

In addition to the very nice view of the palace from many points in the surrounding park - including the famous Nijubashi Bridge, or "double bridge", so named for its watery reflection - guests are allowed in the East Garden Higashi-Gyoen, one of the few spaces that are open to the public.
