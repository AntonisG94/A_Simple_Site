    <span class="name">Sebastião Salgado</span>
    <span class="border"></span>
    <p>Sebastião Salgado is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the greatest living photographers. He mainly works in the field of social documentary, portraying humanity during some of its most devastating stages. Salgado has published many books over the course of his nearly 50-year career, but some of the most iconic are Genesis, Other Americas, Workers and Terra.To create his images, he has travelled all over the world and has visited more than 120 countries.

    <span class="name">Peter Lindbergh</span>
    <span class="border"></span>
    <p>In a world where everything is post-processed and where digital manipulation has become an inseparable part of photography, there are few artists who refuse to “polish” their images. Peter Lindbergh is one of them. He is known for his authentic, soulful and natural-looking portraits. Through his work he introduced a new concept of beauty: raw and realistic. Due to this achievement, he’s considered to be among the pioneers in contemporary photography.</p>

    <span class="name">Henri Cartier-Bresson</span>
    <span class="border"></span>
    <p>In street photography there’s one name that inevitably comes to mind: Henri Cartier-Bresson, the true master of capturing the decisive moment. He was a French humanist photographer and also one of the founders of the iconic photographic cooperative Magnum Photos. He was also one of the first photographers to use 35 mm film while others were still mainly using the bulky and heavy medium format cameras. He was almost always accompanied by his Leica. Light and swift, it was the perfect tool for capturing that fleeting moment. It gave Cartier-Bresson what he called “the velvet hand…the hawk’s eye”.</p>

  <div class="section" id="p4">
    <span class="name">Richard Avedon</span>
    <span class="border"></span>
    <p>Richard Avedon was an American photographer known for his black and white portraits. He developed a passion for photography at a very early age – he was only 12 when he joined the Young Men’s Hebrew Association Camera Club. When he started his career and began working for Harper’s Bazaar, he used to deny the studio environment – he preferred to take photos of the models on the street, on the beach, or at the circus. That made his portraits truly natural and gave his work a distinct look that was highly appreciated.</p>

  <div class="section" id="p5">
    <span class="name">Steve McCurry</span>
    <span class="border"></span>
    <p>Steve McCurry is an American photographer who is mainly known for his work as a photojournalist. His most famous photograph, “Afghan Girl”, is an outstanding image which you’ve all probably seen on a National Geographic cover. He bravely covered more than a few armed conflicts such as the Lebanon Civil War, the Cambodian Civil War and the Iran-Iraq War. Over the years he faced a couple of extremely dangerous situations which brought him close to losing his life. He was a survivor in an airplane crash in Yugoslavia and he nearly drowned in India. Today, Steve McCurry is honoured around the globe and he contributes to renowned magazines all over the world.</p>

He has photographed more than 35 tribes all over the world, and has traveled to numerous locations in Asia, Africa, South America and Europe. During his prolific work over the last decade, he has been criticized multiple times by different sources. He has been accused of staging the people in his photographs so that they look good for the image, but without taking the time to get to know them and their culture.</p>

  <div class="section" id="p7">
    <span class="name">Eugenio Requenco</span>
    <span class="border"></span>

  <div class="section" id="p8">
    <span class="name">Andreas Gursky</span>
    <span class="border"></span>
    <p>Gursky is a German photographer who is famous for his large format images. They often include landscape, architecture or aerial views. The sense of vastness in his work is often due to digital enhancements in post-production. The author has been quite honest about the fact that he digitally manipulates the pictures, but that definitely doesn’t decrease their value.</p>
